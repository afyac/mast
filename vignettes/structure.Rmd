## Structure

This is an overall structure of the `mast` package, which details how `mast` 
relates to `samrat` and how it will do various munging tasks.

The package structure is shown below:

1. `mast`: Cleaning and collating datasets required for mortality analysis. This 
includes parameter data sets, surveys, demography sources and predictor
covariates. 

2. `samrat`: Mortality analysis of data sets generated by `mast`
