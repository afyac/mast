Notes on the prospective approach (quick_som):

1. Malaria imputation turned on
2. Given the gap between the pop sources and our analysis period, we
now have an early y start just for creating demography time series that start
in 2014, we then correct this later.
3. In the mortality estimation script correct the initial ts to only be for the
period of interest.
4. Convert scripts capture most of the weird foibles in updating the data sets
5. The imputation has issues with the long lagged variables in the first year,
so need to figure out what's going on there/how that should be done.s
6. No refugees data available so commented this out
7. Commented out the created of xobs in the predictors, i.e. binding with survey data
8.


Notes on dec_som:

1. Have renamed cause of deaths based on a look up table (mast::cause_of_death)
2. Belet Weyne with population of IDPs > than population total in all population sources.
3. Need to flag the proportion of IDPs and the population creation process. Seems iffy...
4. Have just averaged Belet Weyne to other admin prop_idps for now

TODO:

1. Data cleaning for smart surveys:
  - removal of incorrect characters (`)
  - detecting incorrect cluster assignments
  - flipped column entries (e.g. sex and age wrong way round)
